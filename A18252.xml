            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>From this ſtepp we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily encounter with the fourth Gate, which is a moſt feruent loue of things eternall.

               <p>At the fifth gate which is called, the Reuelation of thinges eternall, God ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth at the eare of the hart, and repleniſheth a ſoule with goodly lightes, and knowledges, euen then darting vpon it (as ſayth <hi>Gerſon)</hi> certaine lightning flaſhes of Paradiſe, as if a torch reflected ſome rayes

               <p>And as the know ledges of our Vnderſtanding, are nothing without the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours of our will; from this gate we paſſe along to the ſixth, which is called, the Antipaſt of Experience, by which we earely begin to taſt in this life the ioyes of Paradiſe, &amp; contentments which cannot bevnſolded.

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:19484:123"/> perfect.</p>
                  <p>Charity beginning hath fiue degrees. 1. Diſtaſt of paſſed crimes. 2. Good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of amendment. 3 Rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of the word of God. 4. Pro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptneſſe to good works. 5. Compaſſion of anothers ill, and ioy at his proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
                  <p>Charity more confirmed hath fiue other degrees. The firſt is, a great puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Conſcience, which is purged by a very frequent examen. 2. The weakening of Concupiſcence. 3. Vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous exerciſe of the inward
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:19484:123"/> powers. For euen as the good operations of exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſenſes, are notes of health of body; ſo the holy occupations of the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, memory, and will are the ſignes of ſpirituall life. 4. A prompt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance of the law of God. 5. A taſtful knowledge of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rityes, and Maximes eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</p>
                  <p>Perfect Charity alſo rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koneth fiue other degrees. 1. To loue your enemies. 2. To take contentedly, and ſuffer couragiouſly all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities. 3. To haue no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:19484:124"/> reſpect, but to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure all things by the feare of God. 4. To be free from all loue of creatures. 5. To yield vp your life, to ſaue a neighbour.</p>
                  <p>There are added alſo nine other degrees of ſeraphicall loue, which are, ſolitude, ſilence, ſuſpenſion, inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rability, inſatiablility, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigability, rapture, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor, extaſy, which would deſerue long diſcourſe, but it is out of the purpoſe, I intend heere.</p>

               <p>FInally, ſeeing in the practiſe of vertues you muſt ſtill haue armes in hand, to deſtroy the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of our aduerſary, and to aduance the affaires of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, recal to memory the twelue Maximes, which I propoſed againſt thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles, which may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.</p>
               <p>The way to reſiſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:19484:131"/> is not to frame with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your ſelfe a ſpirituall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility which is moued at nothing. It is hard to attayne it, ſo ſenſible is ſelf loue, and had you it, it were to be a ſtone, not a man. It is not to driue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way one temptation by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and to do one euill to be freed from another; for to purſue that courſe is to waſh your ſelfe with inke. It is not to hide your ſelfe vpon all occaſions, &amp; neuer to doe good for feare you muſt fight againſt euil, but manfully to reſiſt in
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:19484:132"/> the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner I will ſhew you. The great ſpirit <hi>Iohn Picus Mirandula</hi> hath collected togeather twelue notable Maximes, the practiſe of which is moſt profitable to wage warre in ſpiritual co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat againſt weakneſſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt Maxime. That you muſt be tempted on what ſide ſoeuer it happen: <hi>In hoc poſiti ſumus.</hi> It is our profeſſion, our trade, our continuall exerciſe. The Eagle complaineth not of het winges, nor the Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingale of her ſong, nor the Peacocke of her trayne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:19484:132"/> it is by kind, and it is as naturall for a man to be tempted, as for a Bird to flye, to ſing, to prune her ſeathers. If you forſake the way of ſpirituall life, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to be tempted, and turne head towards worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly contentments, hold it for an infalliable verity, you ſhal thereby be the further engaged, and which is worſe, without comfort, honour, merit, or recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence: you ſhal leaue a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per croſſe, which if you wel knew how to manage, would load you no more
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:19484:133"/> then feathers do the Bird: you will forſake it (ſay I) to take another hard, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy, and bloudy, which will put you into confra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity with the bad thiefe. The great Prelate of Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce <hi>Sidonius Apollinaris</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that a certaine man called <hi>Maximus</hi> being arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at the height of honor by vnlawfull, and indirect wayes, much grieued from the firſt day, and breathing out many ſighes, ſpake theſe words: <hi>Felicem te Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocle, qui non longius vno pra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio regni neceſsitatem tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisti.</hi>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:19484:133"/> O <hi>Damocles,</hi> I eſteeme thee moſt happy to haue byn a King only the ſpace of a dinner tyme. It is now a whole day, that I haue beene ſo, &amp; can no longer endure it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond. Remember that in the affaires of the world, we fight a long ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, we trauell more pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, we reape more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſly, the end of one toyle is the beginning of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In paines-taking there is no other hope, but euer to labour, and a temporal toyle doeth many tymes
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:19484:134"/> draw after it an eternall payne.</p>
               <p>The third. Is it not a meere folly to belieue a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, an eternal life, a Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, who made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelfe a ladder of the Croſſe to aſcend to the throne of his glory; &amp; you in the meane tyme to be deſirous to liue heere with armes acroſſe, to ſee the Maiſter open the way of heauen thorough ſo many thornes, &amp; the ſeruant not to be willing to tread, but vpon flowers? To ſee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a head all waſted, and
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:19484:134"/> worne with ſufleringes, a delicate member, as one ſhould put feet of flaxe to a brazen Coloſſus?</p>
               <p>The fourth. Were there no other fruit in temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the conformity, which we thereby haue with Ieſus Chriſt who is the ſoueraigne Wiſedome, it were to be highly reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced. A braue Captaine ſayd to a Soldiar who dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him: Thou who wouldeſt haue beene vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne all thy life tyme, it is no ſmall honour for thee to dye this day with thy
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:19484:135"/> maiſter: and who would not hold it a great glory to haue the ſonne of God for Captaine, for companion, for ſpectatour, for theater, for guerdon in all his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and tribulations? Who would not account it a great dignity to be daily crucified with him, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtend his handes, and armes vpon the Croſſe, in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding them from viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, rapincs, ruines, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the ſpirit of lying tranſporteth vs? To fetter your feet in hindering the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to runne after the vnbride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:19484:135"/> deſires of your hart. To make bitter your tongue in ſubduing the pleaſures of your taſt. To wound your body in beating down the incitementes of fleſh, by a holy mortification. To leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen your ſelfe by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of honour according to the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of him, who being able alwaies to wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke vpon the winges of Cherubims, would creepe among vs like a little wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of the earth. What a glory were it to ſay with S. <hi>Paul, Ego stigmata Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini Ieſu in corpore meo porte.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:19484:136"/>
               <p>The fifth. Not to confide in humane remedyes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you vndertake to ouerco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me a temptation; It is not a thing which depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely vpon vs; It is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary God go before, and we thereunto contribute our free will: If he watch not ouer our heads, it will be a hard matter for vs to keepe Centinell. No crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſo feeble, as he, who holdeth himſelfe for ſtrong, being onely armed with his owne confidence: <hi>Multa in homine bona fiunt, que non facit homo. Nulla ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rò
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:19484:136"/> facit homo bona que non De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us praeſtet vt faciat home,</hi> ſaith the Councel of <hi>Orange.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good things are done in man, which man doth not, and man doth no good which God doth not. Who thinks to reſiſt temptations without his helpe, is like him that haſtneth to the warrs, and ſtumbles at the threſhold of his own doore. And therefore an effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all meanes in this battel is to inſiſt much on prayer, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially at the firſt aproach of a temptation.</p>
               <p>The ſixth. When you

               </p>
               <p>The ſeauenth. Content
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:19484:137"/> not your ſelfe only not to be beaten, but aſſayle your enemy: when Sathan ſets a ſnare to entrap you, make it an inſtrument of merit. If he preſent a good worke to you, which glittereth in the world thereby to te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt you with Pride, make a good worke of it, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue vanity, referring all to the greater honour of God.</p>
               <p>The eight. When you are in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat, fight with alacrity, as if you already were certaine of the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Turne away the eye of you confideration fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:19484:138"/> you ſuffer, and hold it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually fixt vpon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. A great vnhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which maketh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to fall headlong into temptation, is that they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue their minds ſo ſtretched and bent vpon the thought of paines, that they cannot abide to behold the rewa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rde which waiteth on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. When the forty Martyrs were in the frozen lake, thirty nine of them looked backe vpon their future crownes, and one of them (vnhapily) thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but his puniſhment.
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:19484:138"/> All of them remayned vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious, except this wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched creature, who ſoyling the glory of his patience, came out of the poole to dy preſently after in his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity. Do you not magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne that which comforted our Sauiour on the Croſſe in the bottomleſſe Abiſſe of Calumnyes, and Dolours, was a mirrour of glory, wherin he ſaw all his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings in crownes? Behold the courſe which is to be held. To ſtay a litle on the preſent, and reſt in a ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g apprehenſion of the future.
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:19484:139"/> And euer to haue theſe wordes of S. <hi>Paul</hi> in your hart: <hi>Momentaneum,</hi> &amp; <hi>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue tribulationis noſtrae, aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num gloriae pondus operatur in nobis.</hi> Fight then with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, as if it were the laſt temptation which ſhould aſſayle you, and be perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that heerein is the ſumme of your predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: when you haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome it, gouerne your ſelfe like a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> readily preſt to enter againe into the liſt, and make one victory the degree for another.</p>
               <p>The ninth. Though you
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:19484:139"/> be valiant, braue not dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, tempt not temptation by caſting your ſelfe into the occaſions thereof, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough preſumption of hart: He that much affecteth ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, inſteed of finding glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry therin, ſhall trace out his owne Tombe.</p>
               <p>The tenth. A ſoueraigne meanes to conquer tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is ſeaſonably to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer the countenances of them freely, to open your hart to your ghoſtly Father to declare your thoughtes, to know them well, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

How many things ſeeme terrible, and impoſſible to vs, which we find ridiculous, and eaſy to ouercome, if we but neuer ſo litle touch them with a finger? In temptations of puſillanimity it is good to repreſent to your ſelf theſe falſe Gyants, as Dwarfes; but in that of concupiſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce you muſt not deſpiſe any thing, rather lay hold of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle threds, as if they would become huge Cables.

               <p>The eleauenth The ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of offence, and ſcandall is, that they liuely repreſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to their imagination, the ſweetneſſe of ſinne, and neuer conſider the pleaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re which is deriued from the victory ouer ſinne.

But quite contrary the ſoule, which hath reſiſted, finds it ſelfe content, generous, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated, ſatisfied with holy comforts, which come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Paradiſe of God. Few men reuolue this thought, which <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth: Behold why the number of the damned
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:19484:142"/> is very great; and yet doth it not leeme to you very reaſonable, that a man, who a thouſand times hath yielded to temptation, once in his life ſhould taſt the ſweetneſſe which is in victory ouer temptation, to reioyce for euer? Many haue beene put from great, and euident precipices by often po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dering theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. Well! To yield, what will be the end?

<pb n="358" facs="tcp:19484:181"/> frendſhip of wicked men is like to bundels of thrones, which keep togeather to burne, and crackle in the flames. Your friendſhip ſhould be vertuous, ſayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, diſintereſſed, if you from it deſire to deriue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fruit.</p>
               <p>Good intention: ſuch as would be fit to cheriſh health &amp; ſtrength to ſerue the ſoule; for a good man ought to ſeeke for merit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in play, and repaſt, as S. <hi>Francis,</hi> who roſe in the night, &amp; fed before a poore hungry fryer, to take from
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:19484:181"/> him the ſhame he had of eating at an extraordinary houre.</p>
               <p>Innocency: For there muſt conſideration be vſed therin, leaſt nature be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued into a brutiſh life, altogeater vnworthy of a generous hart. Behind then comes gluttonny, intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate gaine, bold ſcoffing, and detraction, which in this Age is very hard to be auoyded.</p>
               <p>The moſt ordinary book in companies of men is ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himſelfe: you ſhall find ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few who are now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes

               <p>Moderation, ſince (as ſayth the Wiſeman) as we muſt not exceſſiuely glut our ſelues with hony: ſo ought one to take heed, that recreations which are made to refreſh the mind, tend not by exorbitancy to diſſolution. It muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued

               <p>VAine conuerſation is that of bablers, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, vain-glorious, and ſuch like.
